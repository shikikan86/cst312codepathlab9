Exploit1: By adding a quote to the end of the URL and getting a database error, you can modify what's inside the quotes to get access to what's in the database through SQL
injection.

Exploit 2: When logging in, if you try a username that doesn't exist, it will return an error. If you use a username that does exist, the same error will be in bold text,
which is useful information to a hacker.

Exploit 3: By typing HTML code into the name field on the contact page, you can send commands such as an alert, although most hackers probably wouldn't alert their victims
that they're getting hacked.

Exploit 4: By changing the id parameter in the URL, you can see the profiles of employees that aren't supposed to be seen by the public. 

Exploit 5: You can place a malicious link in the contact form that can alter the contents of a database.
